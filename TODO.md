- [x] Record metadata at end of run
- [x] Read metadata at start of run
- [ ] Running in date groups, ordering by fastest
- [x] merge on metadata, don't overwrite
- [x] sort the groups as well. our orderer will get called with groups and then with examples in the groups
- [x] parent groups will reflect the most relevant of their deepest children
- [x] refactoring: make RunResults a class instead of a hash. Should clean up a lot
